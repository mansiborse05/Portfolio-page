                <p>Hi! I'm Mansi Borse, a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design. With expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I thrive on bringing ideas to life through code <br> 
                I'm particularly skilled in front-end development, utilizing frameworks like React to build dynamic and responsive applications. <br>
                Currently, I'm working on several exciting projects that challenge my skills and expand my knowledge. I'm delving into full-stack development and exploring technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB, aiming to build robust and scalable applications. <br>
                In my free time, you can find me exploring the latest design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or learning about emerging technologies in the web development space. I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and collaborate on innovative projects! <br>
                I believe in continuous learning and regularly explore new technologies. I did contribute to projects that positively impact users and the community.</p>
